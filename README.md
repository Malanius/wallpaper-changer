> Because every desktop deserves a bit of waifu energy ✨

> *MeidoGPT*

## 🐾 Requirements

- A Wayland compositor worthy of your setup, such as [Hyprland](https://hypr.land/) 💫
- [Hyprpaper](https://wiki.hypr.land/Hypr-Ecosystem/hyprpaper/) — the paper that hyprs your land 🖼️
- make — for automated installation, because we’re not barbarians
- systemd — yes, yes, I know... but it just works, okay? 🙃

## 💻 Usage

1. Clone this repo like a true terminal ninja 🥷
1. Set `WALLPAPER_DIR` in `random_wallpaper.sh` to your sacred folder of beautiful backgrounds (bonus points for waifus) 💕
1. (Optional) Adjust the timeout in `wallpaper_changer.timer` to match your patience level ⏳
1. Run `make install` to gracefully summon the systemd spirits 🕯️
1. Sit back and bask in the endless rotation of your beloved wallpapers 🌈
1. (Optional, for Omarchy disciples) Disable your hotkey for theme wallpaper change — for maximum aesthetic control:

    ```hyprlang
    # ~/.config/hypr/bindings.conf
    unbind = SUPER CTRL, SPACE
    ```
